#Kinematics
This the kinematics folder for my project. it contains: 
fun_path.py - a short, ~10 sec demonstration of the robot following a path using my custom Inverse Kinematics function. 
communication.py - a demonstration of sending angle data based off of a single point
kinematics.py - the container for my inverse kinematics function
